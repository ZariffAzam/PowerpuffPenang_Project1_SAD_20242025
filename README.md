Student-Supervisor Management System as part of UTM NexScholar

The Student Supervisor Management System is a new digital platform developed as part of the NexScholar initiative at University Technology Malaysia (UTM). It is designed to transform and streamline the entire postgraduate research journey by providing a structured and efficient way for students and supervisors to manage their collaboration. Moving away from the outdated, manual processes such as emails, WhatsApp messages, and Excel sheets, this system offers a centralized environment for supervisor assignment, communication, progress tracking, meeting scheduling, and overall research management.
